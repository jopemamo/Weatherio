# Welcome to Weatherio

Weatherio is a simple Weather App that shows the weather at your current location and another two default ones. This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). This framework seemed the most suitable for a quickstart with React Native. While creating the Dashboard, unit tests were added.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo


## Run tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Future Improvements

- Show the name of your current location.
- Sunset and sunrise in the detailed view.
- UI/UX Enhancements: Refine the user interface for better accessibility and aesthetic appeal.
- Allow to save locations.
